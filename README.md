# AerialRelayNode

## Introduction
In this study, two architectural models of Aerial Relay Node (ARN) based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) were designed. ARN can be used to provide a communication line a disaster area by forwarding data that received from the User Equipments (UEs) to the nearest macro base station (MBS) and vice versa. The first model uses an amplify-and-forward (AF) type relay node which uses the 4th generation which is 4G LTE/LTEA network both on the fronthaul (ARN-MBS) and access (ARN-UEs). This model generally works as a repeater or amplifier. Meanwhile for the second model, ARN that equipped with decode-and-forward (DF) type relay node works like a mobile hotspot where 4G LTE/LTEA is used in the fronthaul and 802.11n WiFi on the access network. In this study, Sumbermujur Village which an area of 16 km2 is used as the object of research. There are three main parameters that studied in each model which are the optimum height of the ARN, the maximum distance between the ARN and the MBS, and the maximum range of the ARN.
